You are given 2 files,
the first is the client code and a PCAP file This pcap file contains the communication with the server, and somehow, among all that traffic,
the client receives the flag from the server Sadly the server is NO LONGER RUNNING as someone spilled some Monster on it because they thought it would make it run faster, so the PCAP file and the client is all we have to go off,
good luck!
